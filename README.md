When we take a look at the year 2018 there are more companies in with negative returns compared to the year 2017. ENPH and RUN were the only companies that had a positive return. RUN having the highest at 84% and DQ having the lowest at -62.6%.

The reason for this could be that DQ had such a high return at the end of 2017 that they opened very high and could not duplicate that in 2018.
